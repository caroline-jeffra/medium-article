          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            A growing body of scholarly inquiry has successfully clarified that early use of the potter’s wheel in eastern Mediterranean archaeological contexts, especially during the Bronze Age, was complex and reflected pre-existing potting practices; intermediate potting practices were used before the wheel throwing technique was eventually developed though the timing of that development is as yet unclear. Previous experimental work done by the author provided, on the foundation created by Roux and her colleagues in several key publications, a comparative collection of material to aid with the identification of wheel coiling methods in archaeological material, specifically at the macroscopic scale and relying on the morphology of surface traces and topography.<br><br>
            This new experiment addresses several gaps in the previous work while also expanding its applicability. In particular, the present experiment compares side by side the suite of surface traces left by two different potting strategies, neither of which was described in Jeffra (2014). Additionally, the role played by inclusions is directly addressed by this experiment, as two different clay recipes were included. Lastly, the present experiment was designed to support further analytical work in the future at the meso scale.<br><br>
            As has been repeatedly stressed by Roux (most expansively in 2019) no single trace alone provides unequivocal proof that a vessel was formed using one technique over another, a point which was affirmed in the author’s previous work (Jeffra 2011). Instead, it is well supported that it is the recurrent grouping of specific traces which is best indicative of forming techniques. This report should serve as a reference to the experimental protocols followed to produce this type set, as well as a starting point for further experiments by others in the future. It should also serve to inform those interested in using the resulting type set as comparative material so that they might better understand the variables tackled within the experiment and assess its applicability to archaeological material. After all, the shapes produced within this experiment were selected to constitute a ‘generalized type set’, as outlined in Jeffra (2021). Lastly, these reports provide detailed descriptions of the specific gestures used by the author in producing wheel thrown pots in particular. This is an often overlooked aspect of experiment reporting, and transparency about the gestures used in particular may also shed light on similarity or difference in interpretation in the future.<br><br>

        <section id="Experimental_Protocols" class="main-section">
          <h2>Experimental Protocols</h2>
          <p>
            Previous work by the author (Jeffra 2015) focused on the demarcation of specific wheel coiling methods as laid out by Roux and Courty (1998), and this work was designed to be complementary. The present experiment differs from the previous one in several aspects. Firstly, distinct coil attachment gestures were used for the wheel coiling technique within this experiment, creating a new set of data to compare against earlier data. A single wheel coiling method was selected for comparison against wheel throwing in order to create an easily comparable dataset based on the same variables. Method 3 was selected for this purpose following its frequent identification with archaeological material in previous studies by the author, though it must be said that this frequent successful identification may be due to the single analytical method (naked eye observation of macroscopic surface traces) and other wheel coiling methods may have gone unrecognized in earlier research (Jeffra 2011, 2013) – indeed the author hopes that future research will prioritize multiple-technique assessment of material to successfully clarify production processes of objects with subtler surface traces.<br><br>
            A second important difference between this and the previous experiment is this experiment’s consideration of the impact of temper on the nature of trace evidence; examples of each vessel were formed using untempered as well as tempered clay. Two commercially available clays were used, selected for their ready availability to others who may wish to replicate this experiment, as well as to ensure consistency of raw material throughout the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, in the interest of maintaining general applicability of this experiment to multiple archaeological contexts, it was not the aim to replicate context-specific clay recipes.<br><br>
            Thirdly, reporting on this experiment provides another opportunity to include discussion of a significant omission from the author’s previous publications on the matter: the specific gestures used for the wheel throwing technique. There is a growing body of scholarly work investigating and reporting on the relationships between potting gestures, skill transmission, and production evidence, and it would be remiss to neglect this aspect of description. As such, the gestures are described in detail below, and can be further supplemented with open-access video recordings of each experimental vessel’s production, available online (https://tracingthewheel.eu). For precision, anatomical terminology is used to describe hand gestures, with relevant terms illustrated in Figure 1.<br><br>

            Lastly, the shapes created for this experiment were not selected solely with specific ceramic traditions in mind. Instead, the experimental type set was produced to adhere to the principle of a generalized type set, as described in Jeffra (2021). The type set was formulated as a foundation for comparison, a starting point from which successful technological assessments can be made in the first instance as well as a means for future experiments to readily direct resources toward more specific questions.<br><br>
            As in the previous experiment, vessel surfaces were left entirely unaltered. The tools were the same: an electric potter’s wheel (Shimpo Whisper-T, operated in a counterclockwise direction), the potter’s hands, a sponge for applying/removing water and finishing the rim, and a wire to cut vessels from the wheel surface. As before, these practices were selected to prevent the appearance of macroscopic traces from tools not verified archaeologically.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558108/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            An electric kiln with a programmable controller was used for firing vessels, and five separate firings took place during 2018-2021. The firing program consisted of three segments: segment 1 ramped 80 degrees C per hour until reaching 345 C, segment 2 ramped 125 degrees C per hour until reaching 595 C, and segment 3 ramped 150 degrees C per hour until reaching 1050 C. The observed temperatures, as displayed by the kiln thermocouple and digital display, deviated slightly from this program, but the curves overall followed the program very closely, as shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
            The specific process of forming the experimental vessels varied depending upon the technique employed, so it is necessary to discuss each in turn. It should also be noted that this experiment was completed by the author. She is a non-specialized, at most part-time, well skilled potter, who has sporadically practiced pottery production by hand for 25 years and the potter’s wheel for 15 years. In this time, she has also used a variety of wheel configurations, both powered and manual, and has completed several experimental programs of a comparable scale to the one reported here.<br><br>

        <section id="Wedged_Coil_Wheel_Coiling" class="main-section">
          <h2>Wedged Coil Wheel Coiling</h2>
          <p>
            Method 3 of the wheel coil technique, as defined by Roux and Courty (1998), is characterized by the use of discontinuous pressures only to form coils, and joining and thinning of those coils as well as shaping the roughout is achieved with the use of RKE. The supposition is that the continuous pressures from using RKE through so much of the overall process will strongly deform coils and wall surfaces, ultimately obscuring most patterns of coil joining (Roux and Courty 1998, 751).<br><br>
            Vessels constructed using method 3 were formed of coils which ranged between 2 and 3 times the final wall thickness. The forming process was consistent across all vessel shapes formed, as well as between the two clay types used. The base of each vessel is created by taking a small mass of clay and compressing it first into a sphere. Pressure is then applied to two opposing poles of the sphere using the forefinger and the thumb of one hand while the other hand supports the sphere along an equatorial line. The mass of clay is then rotated around its poles with the application of discontinuous, pinching pressure. These gestures quickly create a lentoid shape, which is then placed in the center of the wheel head. Coils are formed by holding a small mass of clay vertically between the two palms and applying rolling pressure bilaterally, to allow a 1.5-2cm coil to extrude downward toward the work surface. The so-called ‘wedged coil’ method of coil building was adapted to wheel coiling for this experiment. ‘Wedged coil’ describes a method of building up wall height by applying coils to the inner surface of the existing wall height with a rolling motion to integrate the mass of the coil into the mass of the wall and distribute that collected mass upward, thus raising the overall wall height. After this application of the coil to raise the wall height, the inner wall surfaces readily show numerous linear crevices from incomplete joining of coil mass to wall mass whereas the outer walls do not; the coils are, after all, applied to the inner surfaces and unless the mass of the wall is pierced in some way during that application, it will only be stretched. If using wedged coiling alone to create a preform, at this stage the potter would fully smooth the traces left on the inner surfaces before thinning and shaping the wall. Alternatively, the thinning and shaping actions might take place after each coil is applied, after several coils are applied, or even once all coils are complete. For wheel coiling within this experiment, the coils were stacked in a clockwise direction in the fashion described above for each vessel before continuous pressures were applied to them using RKE.<br><br>
            Using an electric wheel, coils were fully joined, and the vessels were thinned and shaped. Once all coils are stacked, rotation is started in a counterclockwise direction. The first action is securing the vessel base fully to the wheel head. With dry hands, gentle continuous pressure is applied to the center of the inside of the base with the fingertips. By moving the pressure application from center toward the vessel wall, it is possible flatten the shape of the inner base and prevent trapping extra air between vessel base and wheel head. Once the application of pressure reaches the inside corner where base meets wall, pressure is applied with the potter’s other hand to the outside of the vessel where the vessel walls come into contact with the wheel head. This creates a closer seal with the wheel head and prevent the ingress of water during later stages of thinning and shaping, which would create a weak point where the vessel could come away from the wheel head.<br><br>
            After fully securing the vessel to the wheel head, water is applied to inner and outer surfaces alike using a small sponge. In this application of water, the sponge and the potter’s hands are held in very light contact with the surfaces to aid in forming a thin layer of slip. The pressure applied is gentle enough to ensure contact but not so strong as to risk any deformation. This thin layer of slip creates better lubrication of the surfaces than water alone. With the surfaces wetted in this way, the walls are thinned and shaped using bilateral pressure applied to the walls in two separate episodes – firstly from top to bottom and then from bottom to top. Working from top to bottom, the hands are interlinked at the thumb and second and third digits of each hand are used to create pinching pressure starting at the rim. This gesture of joined hands to pinch the walls is held steady and moved down the full height of the walls with the effect of largely eradicating perceptible (by touch) coil join crevices. By and large, this ‘first pass’ from rim to base does very little to determine the final shape of the vessel, but rather serves to redistribute wall mass more symmetrically and complete the joining of the coils.<br><br>
            The ‘second pass’ of continuous pressure application uses a similar gesture – hands interlinked at the thumbs and second and third digits of each hand acting as pincers – this time starting at the lowermost point of the vessel wall and working upwards. In this case, pressure is applied to redistribute wall mass upward and according to the desired final shape. In shaping, this means that extra pressure applied using the fingers on the inner wall will force the wall outward (making the vessel diameter larger), while consistent pressure between both inner and outer wall fingers will force the wall to become taller (making the vessel height greater). For this experiment, in no case was it necessary to constrict the diameter of the vessels being formed, but it should be noted that this constriction action would have necessitated different, specialized gestures. The bottom-to-top pressure action is repeated multiple times, with less and less pressure needed each time as the vessel becomes thinner and closer to completion.<br><br>
            Once the desired shape and wall thickness is reached, the rim is tidied by bracing either side (inner and outer) of the upper wall using a thumb and forefinger of one hand, and slight downward pressure would be applied using the forefinger of the opposite hand. Any final excess water pooling in the interior base is retrieved using a sponge at this point. The rotation of the wheel head is then stopped, and the base is cut from the wheel head using a twisted wire.<br><br>

        <section id="Wheel_Throwing" class="main-section">
          <h2>Wheel Throwing</h2>
          <p>
            The wheel throwing technique is characterized by the use of a use of a potter’s wheel to rapidly rotate a mass of clay, and using the rotational inertia of that rotation to manipulate that mass and draw it up and/or out into the desired vessel shape. Wheel thrown vessels can be thrown off the hump – that is, a single mass is used to produce multiple vessels in succession – or they can be thrown singly. In this experiment, vessels were thrown one by one rather than off the hump. Within the operating procedures of this forming technique, specific actions were undertaken, corresponding with specific gestures, for the production of all wheel thrown vessels, though there was some variation in the application of those gestures (as well as supplementary actions/gestures depending on the desired final vessel form).<br><br>
            The wheel throwing technique undertaken by the author is divisible into six operating procedures: freehand wedging and placement on wheel head, rotational wedging and centering, opening the volume, establishing the walls, thinning and shaping, and removing from wheel head. Each of these operational procedures can be understood in terms of their aims and a description of accompanying gestures. The gestures are described here in detail to supplement the video recordings of the potting process. It should be noted that aside from the first and final operating procedures (freehand wedging and placement on wheel head, and removing from wheel head), all operating procedures are completed with rapid rotation of the wheel and the repeated, liberal application of water to the clay surface. Once the volume is opened to create an interior, this applied water can gather there and must be removed periodically with a sponge or cloth.<br><br>
              <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558090/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Freehand wedging and placement on wheel head</h3>
            Freehand wedging is a transitional operation bridging between paste preparation and wheel throwing, when the desired amount of clay for wheel throwing is removed from the larger mass of prepared clay. This smaller amount represents the total quantity of clay required for producing a single vessel (in the case of throwing vessels one by one), which is attached to the wheel head securely with a minimum of trapped air so that adhesion can be maintained throughout the remainder of the wheel throwing process. Freehand wedging re-homogenizes the mass of clay for throwing with percussive force, compressing the mass to drive trapped air out.<br><br>
            The clay is cupped in one hand and is struck by the opposite hand in a clapping motion, which is also held in a relaxed cupping position. Rather than a clapping motion where hands meet palm to palm, the hands instead meet with 45’ rotation, and the heel of the hand is used to strike (see Figure 3). After each strike, the mass of clay is rotated slightly so that successive strikes reach different areas. Through this constant rotation, the mass is homogenized and formed into a roughly spherical shape. Larger masses of clay for larger vessels are instead formed into a rough ovoid shape. In either case, the mass is roughly shaped in order to present a regular convex surface when attaching the mass to the wheel head. In this way, the risk of trapping air between clay mass and wheel head is minimized; if air were to become trapped in this way then it would present a greater risk for the clay mass to pull away from the wheel head during potting, resulting in vessel failure.<br><br>
            Placement on the wheel head is completed by gently throwing the mass of clay down onto the surface of the wheel head so that it strikes as close to the center as possible. In the present experiment, if the clay mass landed off center then it was possible to gently slide the clay to the correct position without losing adhesion. This was done by applying firm and gentle pressure to the far side of the clay using the palms of both hands and pulling it toward the potter’s body. These repositioning actions were not attempted for distances of more than 3-4 cm.<br><br>
            <h3>Rotational wedging and centering</h3>
            Once affixed to the wheel, the mass of clay can be rotationally wedged and centered completely. The aim of this operating procedure is to force out any remaining trapped air from the clay mass, to ‘warm up’ the clay and make it more workable for subsequent actions, and to ensure that the mass is properly centered and symmetrical. The gestures for this procedure are performed to alternate between bilateral pressure (to more or less triple the height of the mass while narrowing its footprint by one third to one half, forming an elongated, truncated cone) and combined downward and lateral pressure (to reduce the overall height and widen the footprint, forming a low and wide cylinder). The alternation between these two shapes – elongated truncated cone and low wide cylinder – has the effect of repeatedly distributing clay mass upwards and back down again. The rotation of the wheel head in conjunction with these actions forces the mass of clay to become symmetrical and centered on the wheel head.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558117/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            In order to raise the mass of clay into a truncated cone, water is first applied to the surface of the clay. The slip formed on the surface acts as a lubricant to allow the mass of clay to be molded using the pressures of the hand gestures rather than the friction that those pressures create. The left hand is placed so that the fifth digit and ulnar border of the hand rest lightly on the wheel head and the mass of clay is in contact with the palm (Figure 4). The hand is bent at the metacarpophalangeal joints with the fingers otherwise straight but relaxed. The right hand is in contact with the left hand during this gesture, with the thenar eminence of the right hand resting on the carpometacarpal joint of the left thumb. The right thumb is looped over the left wrist, resting on the back of the left hand, and the left fingers are in contact with the mass of clay from the metacarpophalangeal joints to the fingertips. This contact directly between the hands, common in many of the gestures described throughout this process, is maintained wherever possible so that the potter can better control and coordinate the spatial relationship between the two hands; this contact is not just about increasing stability or strength but also serves the important function of providing feedback signaling as well.<br><br>
            The bilateral pressure exerted on the mass of clay comes from contact by the thenar eminence of the left hand (supported by the thumb of the right hand in its position) and the palmar surfaces of the fingers of the right hand. The hands apply pressure to the mass of clay at the lowest point, closest to the wheel head, and the hands together are raised to exert pressure higher on the mass as the truncated cone grows taller.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558138/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Once the truncated cone is established, the next gestures serve to deform the mass of clay into a low and wide cylinder. The left hand is placed atop the clay mass so that the peak is in contact with the thenar eminence (Figure 5). As before, the left hand thenar eminence is supported by the thumb of the right hand. The fingers of the right hand are bent at the metacarpophalangeal joints with their palmar surfaces in contact with the mass of clay at its side. The left hand fingers are bent at the metacarpophalangeal joints and rest atop the right hand fingers for support. This gesture is used to apply even, downward pressure to the clay mass led by the thenar eminence of the left hand. The palmar surfaces of the right hand’s fingers act to hold the sides of the mass steady, forcing the mass to expand outward uniformly as the height is reduced. The hands are held in this gesture and moved downward as a unit.<br><br>
            Once the clay mass is appropriately reduced in height, the top is flattened. This is done using downward pressure from the ulnar border of the right hand’s fourth digit. The right hand is held so that the third and fourth digits are bent at the metacarpophalangeal joint and the interphalangeal joint of the thumb is resting on the radial border of the third digit’s proximal interphalangeal joint. The second and the fifth digits of the right hand are relaxed but held straight and out of the way. The left hand thumb’s interphalangeal joint rests near the right hand’s thumb atop the right hand’s radial border of its third digit’s distal interphalangeal joint. It is in this way that both thumbs reinforce the strength of the third and fourth digits of the right hand as downward pressure is applied to the top of the clay mass, creating a level surface prior to the next operating procedure.<br><br>
            <h3>Opening the volume</h3>
            The aim of the operating procedure “opening the volume” is to create a well centered void of an appropriate depth within the mass of clay so that the vessel base is the desired thickness and diameter, and clay mass is distributed appropriately to form symmetrical walls. To do this, it is first necessary to create a small hole in the centered mass. This hole is then widened and the inner base surface is evened and compressed.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558096/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Centering the aperture on the clay mass requires the application of pressure to a point very slightly offset from the center of rotation. By offsetting the point of pressure, the potter must hold their finger in tension as they pull the mass of clay very slightly outward and press down. In this way, the clay is forced to move around a finger held in tension, and a void which is slightly wider than the finger is created. Both hands are placed so that their radial borders are in light contact with the wheel head and the hypothenar eminences through the length of the fifth digits are in light contact with the lowermost portion of the mass of clay (Figure 6). The right thumb is bent at its interphalangeal joint so that its tip is oriented more or less perpendicular to the wheel head. The left thumb rests on the dorsal surface of the right thumb’s interphalangeal joint. The two thumbs apply downward pressure, flexing at their metacarpophalangeal joints, until they nearly reach the wheel head. The placement of hands in contact with the wheel head alongside the clay mass is an important aspect, as they provide feedback to the potter about the depth of the void as it is created, which effectively establishes the thickness of the vessel base.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558105/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Once the full depth of the void is created (and therefore the thickness of the base), the aperture must be widened. This action sets the approximate dimensions of the base diameter and prepares for subsequent actions to establish, shape, and thin the walls. The gestures for this are completed with a steady lateral, pulling motion where pressure is applied to the mass of clay from the inner side closest to the potter’s body and pulled further. This pulling action, combined with the rotation of the wheel, drives the clay outward and symmetrically opens the aperture to the needed dimensions.<br><br>
            The right hand is held so that the third and fourth digits are bent at the metacarpophalangeal joint and making contact with the inner surface of the clay mass closest to the potter’s body. The tip of the thumb rests on the outer surface of the clay mass closest to the potter’s body. The second and the fifth digits of the right hand are relaxed but held straight and out of the way. The left hand supports and strengthens the position of the right hand. The second and third digits rest on the dorsal surface of the right hand’s third and fourth digits, between the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The thumb of the left hand rests on the dorsal surface of the right thumb’s metacarpophalangeal joint (Figure 7). In effect, the portion of the clay mass closest to the potter’s body is pinched between the fingertips and the thumb of the right hand. The left hand reinforces the pressure of pulling the right fingers toward the right thumb while keeping the thumb stationary. As this pinching movement is performed, the fingers of the right hand are curled by flexing the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. This curling action is controlled and slow so that the fingers can move levelly without gouging into the base (to create thin areas) or lifting (to create thicker areas).<br><br>
            <h3>Establishing the walls</h3>
            The previous gesture of widening the aperture creates a volume which can be described as a torus of wall mass sitting atop the disc of the base. The aim of establishing the walls is to transform the torus-shaped mass of clay sitting atop the roughed out base into roughed out walls. This operating procedure therefore realigns the placement of that torus with the dimensions of the base before altering its morphology so that it is more readily thinned and shaped in the subsequent operating procedure. <br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558102/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Prior to the first gesture of this operating procedure, the disc diameter corresponds to the inner diameter of the torus (see Figure 8). The first gesture used for this operating procedure is performed to fold the walls in. Folding the walls in reduces the torus in size so that instead, its major diameter matches that of the base disc, reestablishing the diameter of the base as the starting point from which the walls of the vessel will rise.<br><br>
            The hands are placed so that their radial borders rest on the surface of the wheel, and the palms from hypothenar eminence through proximal interphalangeal digital creases are in contact with the clay where it meets the head of the wheel. The hands are positioned so that the hands are at a 45’ angle to the wheel head, palms facing upward and near-contact between the carpometacarpal joint of the fifth digit. This position has the effect of cupping the torus along the palms and when the hands are rotated slowly inward the pressure exerted has a rolling or folding effect. The torus is forced to constrict into a smaller diameter through this consistent but strong pressure.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558114/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Folding the walls in in this way does have the potential to redistribute clay mass asymmetrically across the torus. The walls are therefore evened up using a knuckle, which has greater potential for strength and stability despite somewhat less sensitivity than using fingertips.<br><br>
            The tip of the right thumb is touched to the middle interphalangeal digital crease of the right hand’s second digit, and that digit is wrapped around the thumb at the point of contact by bending the second digit at its proximal interphalangeal joint. The remaining digits of the right hand are flexed into a loose fist to tuck them out of the way. The thumb of the left hand is placed palmar surface to palmar surface with the right thumb, so that the left thumb is looped behind the second digit and right thumb configuration. The second and third digits of the left hand are loosely flexed, while the remaining fourth and fifth digits are flexed to tuck them out of the way. Pressure is applied to the exterior of the clay volume using the ulnar border of the flexed and supported second digit, while at the same time pressure is applied to the interior of the clay volume using the fingertips of the second and third digits of the left hand (see Figure 9). This gestural configuration is used to apply pressure first from the exterior where the clay mass meets the wheel head. Corresponding pressure is then applied from the interior wall where it meets the base. The locations of these applications of pressure are offset from one another due to the base thickness, which results in the presence of a sinuous curve. The hands are held in position relative to one another and moved up the vessel wall and slightly inward toward the axis of rotation. This upward movement of the hands forces the vessel wall to undulate through the pressure of the sinuous curve thereby homogenizing the wall thickness and morphology; clay in excess of the determined thickness established by the gesture is redistributed upward.<br><br>
            <h3>Thinning and shaping</h3>
            The operational procedure of thinning and shaping transforms the walls established from the previous actions into the final morphology and dimensions desired of the vessel being created. Two gestures are completed to transform the vessel morphology and to finish the rim morphology, respectively. The first gesture of this procedure mirrors that of the final gesture of the previous procedure; a sinuous curve is formed in the lowermost portion of the vessel wall and this curve is drawn upwards to force the deformation of the wall. This approach is combined with lateral pressures to pull the wall diameter wider or else greater pinch pressure to draw the wall mass upwards to raise the height.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558111/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            The gesture used for wall thinning and shaping acts to pinch the wall between the fingers of the right hand from the exterior and the fingers of the left hand on the interior. On the right hand, the thumbtip presses on the palmar surface of the distal interphalangeal joint on the third digit. The second digit is extended alongside the third digit and kept in constant firm contact for strength and support. The fourth and fifth digits are flexed and tucked out of the way. The left hand third and fourth digits are held in a gentle flex position, with the second and the fifth digits held extended and lifted to be out of the way. The left thumb tip is placed atop the dorsal surface of the right hand on its thumb’s metacarpophalangeal joint (see Figure 10).<br><br>
            As before, this gestural configuration is used to apply pressure first from the exterior where the clay mass meets the wheel head. Corresponding pressure is then applied from the interior wall where it meets the base. The offset application of pressure again results in a sinuous curve. The hands are held in a fixed position relative to one another and moved up the vessel wall. This upward movement of the hands forces the vessel wall to undulate through the pressure of the sinuous curve to redistribute excess clay mass upward along the desired trajectory of the vessel wall’s curves. This gesture is repeated a number of times to transform the walls in stages. Each pass of this gesture from vessel base to rim is an incremental step morphologically from vessel roughout to vessel preform.<br><br>
            Once walls have been raised into the desired morphology the rim is often slightly asymmetrical or otherwise irregular. The gesture for tidying the rim applies pressure to either side of the upper wall (interior and exterior) as well as atop the rim to create a uniform rounded curve.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558120/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            This gesture consists of the left hand second and third digits flexing at the metacarpophalangeal joints and being used in conjunction with the thumb of the same hand. The palmar surface of the second fingertip is applied to the uppermost area of the vessel wall interior. At the same time, the palmar surface of the left thumb tip is applied to the uppermost area of the vessel wall exterior. The remaining digits are held extended and out of the way. The right second and third digits are held so that they are in contact with the uppermost edge of the vessel rim, and touch the left hand at the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger as well as the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (see Figure 11). The points of contact with the left hand – upper interior and exterior – are held steady with gentle support while the fingers of the right hand apply slightly stronger downward pressure. Once the rim profile has been transformed from an inverted ‘V’ (or similar) to an inverted ‘U’, the gesture is complete.<br><br>
            <h3>Removing from wheel head</h3>
            The final operational procedure releases the completed vessel preform from its attachment to the wheel head for drying, further finishing actions, and later firing. Excess water and slip are removed from the exterior surface and interior base of the vessel with rotation. Within this experiment, the rotation of the wheel is stopped at this point and a thin, twisted flexible wire is used to cut through the base where it is attached to the wheel head. The hands are spaced so that they are wider than the diameter of the vessel to be cut from the wheel. The wire is held taut between both hands and then gripped so that it is pressed against the wheel head with each thumb. While pressing down against the wheel surface and keeping the wire in tension, the hands slide along the wheel surface to force the wire underneath the vessel and across the wheel surface, completing the cut. Following this, the wire is set aside and the vessel is carefully lifted with both hands from the wheel surface.<br><br>

        <section id="Traces_Observed" class="main-section">
          <h2>Traces Observed</h2>
          <p>
            The macroscopic traces observed on vessel surfaces conform to the range discussed by Roux (2019). These individual traces were never found to be correlated with one specific forming technique when found in isolation; instead – as before – the combination of specific traces appearing together, and the configuration of those traces seemed to have the best indication of forming technique. The following traces relating to both forming and finishing were observed in the experimental type set.<br><br>
            The vast majority of traces observed are indicative of what Roux has identified as ‘irregular topography’, that is “a relief with hollows and protrusions” (2019, 144). It is important to note also that these hollows and protrusions can be further described in terms of their “dimensions; morphology; the line, rectilinear and curvilinear (sinuous); orientation, vertical, horizontal, oblique, and concentric; and localization” (Roux 2019, 144).<br><br>
            <h3>Hollows</h3>
            Hollows observed included fissures, crevices, depressions, and imprints. As such, they represent features which plunge into the plane of the vessel surface.<br><br>
            <h3>Fissures</h3>
            Fissures, the <code>“deep incisions situated at the limit of juxtaposed elements” (Roux 2019, 145)</code>, principally appear on interior surfaces and range significantly in length. Their orientation includes horizontal, oblique, and concentric examples, often on the same vessel, and the line can be characterized as curvilinear. The presence of this trace did not appear to be influenced by the choice of clay; fissures were present in tempered and untempered examples alike, though it should be stated that untempered examples present the traces somewhat more clearly. Figure 12 shows two such examples.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558123/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Crevices</h3>
            A lesser-observed type of hollow is the crevice, identifiable as “tears in the paste […] either left by tools and formed after superficial pull-outs of a paste with too little hygrometry […] or on the body of wheel-fashioned pastes stretched too fast” (Roux 2019, 145). In the experimental type set described here, it was for the latter reason that these crevices were formed. They are often visible at the widest point of the vessel, whether on interior or exterior surface. They are often quite short and oblique to vertical in orientation. They also tend to occur in small clusters; 2-3 or more will often be visible as a small group in one area of the vessel wall (see Figure 13). Crevices occur on tempered and untempered vessels alike, though it can be noted that the most severe (i.e. greatest number clustered together and longest crevices) were observed on a tempered example.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558153/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Depressions</h3>
            Depressions feature with somewhat low frequency within the experimental type set, and are almost exclusively observed on exterior surfaces. They are defined as “hollows with diffuse contours” (Roux 2019, 144). The morphology of these contours can be indicative of the mechanics of their creation. Within the type set, the most common cause of depressions relates to the presence of areas where walls are thinner compared to adjacent areas. During the application of RKE these thinner areas are weak points and the wall collapses inward slightly. Figure 14 illustrates this, and the thinner area of the wall is due in this case to the location of a coil end.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558099/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Imprints</h3>
            Imprints are identifiable as “negatives left by artifacts or fingers during the course of the different fashioning and finishing operations” (Roux 2019, 145), and are present on virtually every tempered example within the experimental type set. As the vast majority related to the movement of tempering material across the vessel surface while the vessel was being subjected to RKE, these traces are, for the most part, short and rectilinear with a horizontal orientation. The temper itself was 2mm, and as such the imprints are more or less the same size. Figure 15 shows examples of imprints from the experimental material.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558141/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Protrusions</h3>
            In addition to the hollows described above, protrusions were also present. These are divisible into continuous protrusions (including bands and undulations) and intermittent protrusions (including crests, compression folds, and bumps).<br><br>
            <h3>Concentric protrusions</h3>
            Both categories of concentric protrusion were observed in the experimental material: undulations and bands. Bands can be thought of as a type of undulation; in both cases, the morphology of the vessel section presents alternation between convex and concave in a sinuous line. While ‘undulations’ refers to the more smoothly sinuous examples, ‘bands’ are “undulations with a rectangular cross section” (Roux 2019, 145).<br><br>
            <h3>Undulations</h3>
            The undulations present in the experimental material range from small to large, occurring more or less over the full height of the vessel wall. Undulations can appear on interior and/or exterior surfaces. They occur equally on tempered and untempered examples, and an illustration of this trace is visible in Figure 16.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558093/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Bands</h3>
            The experimental material presented relatively few examples with bands, though there was little difference between tempered and untempered examples in terms of morphology or frequency (see Figure 17). As with undulations, the bands range from small to large, more or less occurring over the full height of the vessel, and appearing on the interior and/or the exterior.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558129/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Intermittent protrusions</h3>
            Intermittent protrusions, unlike concentric protrusions, are discontinuous and discrete in nature, with a variety of specific variations possible. A number of these are present on the experimental type set.<br><br>
            <h3>Crests</h3>
            Crests, “the result of accumulation of clay slurry […], present as filiform elevations” (Roux 2019, 145) are observed on tempered and untempered examples alike. These relate almost entirely to the procedure of removing the vessel from the wheel surface, and often portions of the palmar surface of fingers and finger tips are recognizable. Crests are more readily identified on untempered vessels, however, as the impact of the 2mm temper on the surface topography in the tempered examples seemed to both reduce the potential for crest formation as well as obscure the visibility of those crests (see Figure 18).<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558132/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Compression folds</h3>
            Compression folds are one of the traces which present the greatest variability within the experimental type set. They are “obtained by the compression of the wall and are often located on narrowing zones (base and neck)” (Roux 2019, 145), and most often appeared on the lower third of vessels in this type set. The folds range from short, small, and thickly distributed over the affected area to long, large, and moderately thickly distributed over the affected area. In any case the orientation of the compression folds is determined by the direction of rotation of the wheel during RKE shaping and thinning – in this case the counterclockwise rotation resulted in folds which are oblique from upper left to lower right on exterior surfaces and lower left to upper right on interior surfaces. Figure 19 shows the range of variation of this trace within the type set, with an untempered small vessel on the left exhibiting many small, fine compression folds as well as another untempered small vessel in the middle exhibiting longer, larger, and more obvious compression folds. The rightmost small tempered vessel in Figure 19 also exhibits small, fine compression folds, illustrating the potential difficulty in recognizing those in conjunction with the topography of a tempered paste’s surfaces.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558147/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            <h3>Bumps</h3>
            The final type of intermittent protrusion observed within the experimental type set was bumps, “the expression of unequal pressures on the walls” (Roux 2019, 145). This trace was not especially frequently observed, but nevertheless appeared in both tempered and untempered examples. The manifestation of this trace did tend to differ, however, with the presence of temper as the bumps themselves seemed to force temper closer to the surface giving greater texture to the surface of the bump overall. Figure 20 shows the manifestation of bumps on both tempered and untempered examples from the experimental type set.<br><br>

        <section id="Diagnostic_Features_of_Wheel_Coiling" class="main-section">
          <h2>Diagnostic Features of Wheel Coiling</h2>
          <p>
            Fully diagnostic features of ‘wedged coil’ wheel coiling are infrequent, though there are recurring trace combinations within this experimental type set. Fissures in general were only observed in the ‘wedged coil’ wheel coiled material, which confirms observations from previous similar experiments by the author (Jeffra 2015). These cannot be taken as diagnostic for the specific variation (wedged coil) being reported here, but the presence of this evidence for “juxtaposed elements” (Roux 2019, 145) in conjunction with evidence of RKE such as undulations and compression folds (such as that seen in Figure 21) is a strong indication of a combination technique. The distribution of horizontal to oblique linear or sinuous fissures at regular intervals for the height of the vessel (in conjunction with other RKE features) does seem to be an especially strong indication of the use of coils and thus wheel coiling.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558135/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Caution in applying this is advisable, for not all examples of known wheel coiling manufacture exhibit the type of fissures described above and it may be the case that fissures manifest as strongly oblique and discontinuous without identifiable regular intervals (see Figure 21 a, c).<br><br>
            The single most notable diagnostic feature is the relationship of traces observed on interior vs exterior surfaces, the result of the forming method itself. As noted above, each coil is applied to the upper, inner surface of the existing wall and the mass of that coil is distributed upward. Even prior to rotation, this creates a volume with fissures from coil joining solely on interior surfaces, which is maintained throughout the potting process. Figure 22 shows an example of this, where the exterior surface shows no evidence of fissures while the interior surface (right) presents a number of long, sinuous, horizontally- to obliquely-oriented fissures at regular intervals for the height of the vessel.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558168/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            The use of this observation as diagnostic for ‘wedged coil’ wheel coiling should be applied with caution and skepticism, however. This combination of traces could very well be observed in other types of wheel coiled vessels, particularly those which were subjected to further finishing operations with and without RKE. It is perhaps more reliable to consider this combination diagnostic among the plainest and least finely finished archaeological examples, and to take the perspective that a single vessel showing this feature is less reliable than an assemblage where this feature is observed among a large proportion of vessels.<br><br>
            Fissures form one part of another relationship which was only observed within the ‘wedged coil’ experimental material: severe fissures on a vessel interior with corresponding depressions on the vessel exterior. Figure 23 shows one such example of this. The two traces are inextricably linked in this case; the fissures visible on the interior surface are located where two ends of one coil met as well as the horizontal boundary between that and the coil lower on the vessel wall. This intersection and the extension of those fissures beyond the intersecting point show on the interior surface that these juxtaposed elements were insufficiently joined together with RKE pressures. The fact that the ‘wedged coil’ method does not produce fissures on exterior surfaces does not preclude the existence of thinner areas of the wall and the depression visible on the exterior view demonstrates that the poor integration of juxtaposed elements manifests there as hollows – in this case a depression – where the vessel wall is thinner.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558159/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            The observation of the relationship between these two discrete traces tidily underlines the need to consider traces in context rather than in isolation.<br><br>
            Compression folds as a category of trace were observed in both wheel coiled and wheel thrown vessels, but the dimensions of these compression folds do vary somewhat based on forming technique. In the case of wheel coiled vessels exhibiting this trace, it most often manifested as longer, wider, and deeper folds (see Figure 24).<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558162/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            It may be the case that subsequent experimental work or different experimental protocols produce less of a marked difference between wheel coiled and wheel thrown manifestations of the compression folds seen here. This experiment, however, confirms a relationship between more significant compression folds and wheel coiling which was seen in the earlier experiment (though in that instance compression folds were referred to as torsional rippling, torsional strain, and torsional tearing).<br><br>
            Beyond just the presence of significant compression folds, there is an observed relationship between those folds and undulations and/or bands which was not observed within the wheel thrown material. Two variations of the interaction between compression folds and undulations/bands were observed (see Figure 25). The first variation is characterized by folds which are largely constrained to the troughs of a vessel surface’s undulations, where the peak of one band of undulation acts as a terminus for the folds. The folds themselves may differ morphologically, but in any case can be considered significant in terms of scale (see Figure 25 a-b, d-e).<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558126/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            The second variation on compression folds and undulation/band interaction unique to wheel coiling is identified by the way that the compression folds bisect the peaks and troughs of the undulations (Figure 25 c, f). The compression folds themselves are not the most significant in terms of width and depth, but given that they are not restricted to the troughs of the undulations, they are among the greatest compression folds in terms of length.<br><br>
            The difference between these two variations on compression fold and undulation/band interaction may be simply that the torsional effects during potting (i.e., the force of rotation in opposition to the braking effect of shaping pressures on the vessel wall) were either stronger or weaker relative to the overall strength of the clay, which resulted in compression folds which either extended beyond the potential terminus of an undulation/band peak, or did not. In any case, the presence of this relationship was a feature restricted to wheel coiled vessels in this type set.<br><br>

        <section id="Diagnostic_Features_of_Wheel_Throwing" class="main-section">
          <h2>Diagnostic Features of Wheel Throwing</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most striking aspect of the wheel thrown vessels within the experimental type set is their overall regularity. Though very few are identified as having regular topography, or “a uniform relief with a continuous plane” (Roux 2019, 143), the irregularities of the topography tend to be very minor and/or low relief.<br><br>
            A first feature observed within the wheel thrown material is the strong tendency toward traces with very low relief, that is, protrusions and hollows which do not deviate significantly from the wider plane of the vessel surface. This low relief does not preclude the presence or variety of observed traces, rather it is a characterization of those traces (see Figure 26).<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558150/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            One particular trace morphology which was exclusive to wheel thrown examples within the type set was the wide distribution of minor compression folds across the majority of a vessel’s surfaces, both interior and exterior. These compression folds follow the same orientation determined by the counterclockwise direction of wheel rotation, but are quite short, narrow, and densely distributed across the vessel. This morphology can result in quite subtle traces, particularly in tempered vessels, but Figure 27 presents the interior and exterior surfaces on one such example.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558144/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            Wheel thrown vessels with temper presented a specific trace relating to the imprinting and dragging of a temper particle across the vessel surface. The resulting trace might be mistaken for a fissure, though in this case the dragged imprint trace has more of a squared or U-shaped cross section to correspond with the way the temper particle digs a furrow across the surface. In contrast, a fissure is more often V-shaped in cross section as the two convex surfaces of the juxtaposed elements meet. What makes the wheel thrown dragged imprint traces distinct is their straight line, their horizontal orientation, and their occasional great length (see Figure 28).<br><br>

          <h2>Comparing Common Traces</h2>
          <p>
            Few significant features were identified in common between wheel coiling and wheel throwing in this experiment, which should be clear from the lack of strong overlap in previous passages above. One type of trace is, however, observed in both wheel coiled and wheel thrown examples: compression folds. What sets this particular trace apart from others held in common is the fact that the dimensions of those traces have some correspondence with forming technique. Figure 29 shows a side by side comparison of two typical vessels, of the same morphology, with compressions folds which differ in dimension.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/21558165/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"><br><br>
            It was found that compression folds for wheel coiled examples often manifest as wider, larger, and more sinuous folds than in wheel thrown vessels. For wheel thrown vessels, compression folds most often appeared as small, narrow, straight, and quite fine. In both cases, the pattern of oblique orientation was consistent, and reflected the direction of wheel rotation.<br><br>

        <section id="Conclusions" class="main-section">
          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The experiment described above provides greater detail of and a glimpse into the nuance necessary when studying and evaluating forming traces. The pluralistic nature of individual traces is already well established (Roux 2019). This work can therefore be situated as an investigation of the relationship between a limited range of variables (vessel shape, forming technique, clay type) which can be immediately employed as comparative material against archaeological examples, to better aid with interpreting those pluralistic traces and understanding them in their context. It is the particular goal of the author that this work assist those who do not have the resources to complete their own experimental programs, and it is for this reason that the products of the experiment have been made available open access for consultation as reference material. This ethos of transparency and open access shaped the way that this experiment has been reported upon above, just as it led to the creation of an open access database of the experimental material (available at https://tracingthewheel.eu). This report is complementary to the content of that database, where photographs, forming videos, and 3D models are available for each vessel in the experimental type set described here.<br><br>
            Looking to the broader context in which this experiment is situation, the fact that transitional techniques such as wheel coiling have been identified has created a renewed opportunity to identify precisely when potters made the leap from those transitional techniques to wheel throwing, a technological boundary which was taken for granted not so long ago. That the presence of such combination techniques previously went unobserved is a strong indication that identifying the boundary between those techniques and wheel throwing should reinforce a need for meticulous study of material and caution in assessments. Even so, as more work is done on the topic of identifying the forming techniques used by potters of the past who were using the wheel, there are more opportunities to successfully identify the transition point from wheel coiling to the wheel throwing technique. This experiment can stand as a reference point for making some of these identifications. What should be very clear, however, is that single archaeological examples within a wider assemblage are not strong evidence alone; indeed, within this very type set of vessels produced with known techniques there is still considerable overlap in clusters of traces. It is therefore the hope of the author that interpretations of techniques observed be based on clearly-described descriptions of individual traces as employed above first, and that future studies of archaeological material focus on seeking patterns within assemblages, rather than solitary examples.<br><br>
